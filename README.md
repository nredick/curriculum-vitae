# Curriculum Vitae

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my CV and hosts the most recent version of my CV [here](https://nedick.github.io/portfolio/cv.pdf).

> This repository was inspired by [jitinnair1/autoCV](https://github.com/jitinnair1/autoCV). The $\LaTeX$ source code is my own.
