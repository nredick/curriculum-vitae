    % Advised by Dr.~James Kirkpatrick \& Dr.~Matthew Tarling.
    \begin{cvitemize}
        \item Designed a guided machine learning workflow for geospatial analysis.
        % \item Our objective was to create a tool that can be used by anyone, regardless of their technical background.

    % Advised by Dr.~James Kirkpatrick \& Dr.~Veronica Prush.
    \begin{cvitemize}
        \item Implemented an image segmentation ML model to identify landslides using geophysical \& morphological indicators.
        % \item Current iteration of the model boasts \textbf{95.3\% accuracy \& a loss of 0.19.}
        % \item Currently \textbf{collaborating with the California Geological Survey} to expand the project scope.} %implement new methods into the landslide identification workflow \& to improve the performance of the model.
